# Third-Site
The third iteration! The only iteration to have lasted more than a full year before being changed. (November 2019 - May 2021)

This little side project of mine, which I'm clearly bound to touch up again sooner or later, has been an amazing experience so far. The goal of this site has always been to represent me in some way, by giving a certain feeling as to what I'm like. Watching this website maturing over time from the sloppy [first site](https://amrojjeh.github.io/First-Site) to what it is [now](https://amrojjeh.gituhb.io), it's an amazing feeling.

Here are all the sites in iteration.

First site: https://amrojjeh.github.io/First-Site/

Second site: https://amrojjeh.github.io/Second-Site/

Third site (this one): https://amrojjeh.github.io/Third-Site/

Current one: https://amrojjeh.github.io/
